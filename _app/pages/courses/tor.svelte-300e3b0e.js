A lot more exciting concepts and theories await for those of you who decide to join us in this course, and weâ€™ll leave you with a basic mathematical understanding of how general relativity works so that you can carry on in the journey!!!",format:"The course will be taken online with multiple instructors, specialising in their respective fields.",instructors:["Kaustubh Murudkar","Vivek Subramaniam"],mentors:["Paurush Punyasheel","Abdul Jawad Khan"],prereqs:["CBSE Class 12 or Equivalent"]},faq:[{q:"Would we deal with complex mathematical models?",a:"No"}],docs:[{desc:"",slides:["https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OeRtzZ8vyAp-mAW5YIpVZRDbfwpq50r3/view"]},{desc:"",slides:["https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OkY6kGX1kTflZGUbt3w10TQchd3eFx8p/view"]}]};function T(e){let a,s,T,Z,A,C,D,I,S,F,N,R,V,Y;return D=new k({props:{faq:x.faq}}),S=new q({props:{type:"PDF",name:"Handout",url:x.handout}}),N=new E({props:{info:x.info}}),V=new j({props:{config:x}}),{c(){a=t("div"),s=t("section"),T=t("h2"),Z=n("Theory of Relativity"),A=i(),C=t("div"),o(D.$$.fragment),I=i(),o(S.$$.fragment),F=i(),o(N.$$.fragment),R=i(),o(V.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(e){a=r(e,"DIV",{});var t=l(a);s=r(t,"SECTION",{class:!0});var n=l(s);T=r(n,"H2",{class:!0});var i=l(T);Z=h(i,"Theory of Relativity"),i.forEach(c),A=f(n),C=r(n,"DIV",{style:!0});var o=l(C);m(D.$$.fragment,o),I=f(o),m(S.$$.fragment,o),o.forEach(c),F=f(n),m(N.$$.fragment,n),n.forEach(c),R=f(t),m(V.$$.fragment,t),t.forEach(c),this.h()},h(){u(T,"class","toc-h2"),d(C,"display","flex"),u(s,"class","svelte-1tucdev")},m(e,t){p(e,a,t),g(a,s),g(s,T),g(T,Z),g(s,A),g(s,C),$(D,C,null),g(C,I),$(S,C,null),g(s,F),$(N,s,null),g(a,R),$(V,a,null),Y=!0},p:v,i(e){Y||(w(D.$$.fragment,e),w(S.$$.fragment,e),w(N.$$.fragment,e),w(V.$$.fragment,e),Y=!0)},o(e){y(D.$$.fragment,e),y(S.$$.fragment,e),y(N.$$.fragment,e),y(V.$$.fragment,e),Y=!1},d(e){e&&c(a),b(D),b(S),b(N),b(V)}}}export default class extends e{constructor(e){super(),a(this,e,null,T,s,{})}}
