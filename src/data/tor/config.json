        "about": "E=MC2, in which energy is put equal to mass multiplied with the square of the velocity of light, showed that a very small amount of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy... the mass and energy were in fact equivalent.-Albert Einstein Beginning with famous thought experiments and a few intuitive principles from Newtonian mechanics, this course closely follows Einstein's arguments leading to the epiphany that time and space are a single entity, spacetime, where physical processes unfold. A lot more exciting concepts and theories await for those of you who decide to join us in this course, and weâ€™ll leave you with a basic mathematical understanding of how general relativity works so that you can carry on in the journey!!!",
