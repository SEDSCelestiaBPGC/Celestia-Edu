        "about": "Beginning with famous thought experiments and a few intuitive principles from Newtonian mechanics, this course closely follows Einstein's arguments leading to the epiphany that time and space are a single entity, spacetime, where physical processes unfold. Weâ€™ll leave you with a basic mathematical understanding of how general relativity works so that you can carry on in the journey!!!"
